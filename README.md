# BusinessTripExpenseReportMidterm
Midterm project for a dual-credit C++ high school course (Year 12).


Project Instructions
-----------------------

This program should be designed and written by a team of students. Here are some suggestions:

One student should design function main, which will call the other functions in the program. The rest of the functions should be 
designed by other team members.

Analyze theprogram requirements so each student is given about the same workload.

Decide on the function names, parameters, and return types in advance.

Use stubs and drivers to test and debug the program.

The program can be implemented either as a multi-file program, or all the functions

can be cut and pasted into the main file.

Here is the assignment. Write a program that calculates and displays the total travel expenses of a businessperson on a trip. 
The program should have functions that ask for and return the following:

- The total number of days spent on the trip

- The time of departure on the first day of the trip, and the time of arrival back home on the last day of the trip

- The amount of any round-trip airfare

- The amount of any car rentals

- Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used. Vehicle allowance is $0.58 per mile.

- Parking fees. (The company allows up to $12 per day. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.)

- Taxi fees. (The company allows up to $40 per day for each day a taxi was used. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the 
employee.)

- Conference or seminar registration fees

- Hotel expenses. (The company allows up to $90 per night for lodging. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.)

- The cost of each meal eaten. On the first day of the trip, breakfast is allowed as an expense if the time of departure is 
before 7 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of departure is before noon. Dinner is allowed if the time of departure is before 6 p.m. 
On the last day of the trip, breakfast is allowed if the time of arrival is after 8 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of arrival is 
after 1 p.m. Dinner is allowed if the time of  arrival is after 7 p.m. The program should only ask for the costs of allowable meals. 
(The company allows up to $18 for breakfast,  $12 for lunch, and $20 for dinner. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the 
employee.)
